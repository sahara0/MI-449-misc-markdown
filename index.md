# Building your own PC

## Ordering parts, and initial motherboard assembly

When building a computer, the most time spent will probably go towards the research and buying of the parts that you plan to use in the PC. It is important to make sure that the parts you buy are compatible with one another, as buying incompatible parts may result in very costly mistakes. However, there are websites you can use to pick computer parts, and also make sure that they are able to be used together in the same pc, such as www.pcpartpicker.com. Using such sites can also calculate the total price of the parts, as well as save the parts to the website. When choosing the parts you want in your computer, it is also good to take into account how long you want to keep the parts for, since you can always upgrade the parts at any time.
The parts that you need to get are:

- [ ] Motherboard
- [ ] CPU
- [ ] RAM
- [ ] HDD and/or SDD
- [ ] Power Supply Unit
- [ ] GPU
- [ ] Computer Case


After finishing your selection of parts, you should purchase them when you are ready to build. If you want to save some money, it may also be a good idea to wait for a sale on a part that may be particularly expensive. After ordering and receiving the parts for the computer, it is time to build it. Make sure that you have an adequate workspace for the build, as you may not have enough room to fit the parts on if what you are working on is too small. **It is also advised to use an anti-static mat or use an anti-static wristband to prevent static electricity from reaching any electric sensitive parts.**

Additional parts may include:

- Screwdrivers
- Zip-Ties
- Anti-static equipment
- Computer Peripherals

To start off, it is usually best to begin with the Motherboard, and the components you put on it, as it becomes harder to put parts onto the motherboard after putting the motherboard into the computer case. To install the CPU follow these steps:

1. Undo the latch next to the CPU socket 
2. Determine the correct alignment of the CPU placement by checking the corners of the CPU for a marking, corresponding with a marked corner of the CPU socket. **Be careful not to touch the CPU pins with your fingers, as the oils from your hand may damage the components**
3. Place the CPU down with the markings in the same alignment, making sure that the CPU pins are secure in the socket holes.
4. Lock the latch next to the CPU socket to lock the CPU in place.
5. Apply a pea-sized amount of thermal paste on top of the CPU
6. Mount the CPU cooler on top of the CPU. Depending on what cooler you have, you may or may not have to remove the bracket around the CPU socket.

Above is an example of the marking on the CPU to determine the correct alignment.

After the installation of the CPU and cooler, you can continue to installing the RAM. To install the RAM, first determine through your motherboard's manual which slots should be populated. This is important if you have only 2 sticks of RAM. Then, begin by unlocking the slots by undoing the latches at either side of the slots you want to place the RAM into. Use the empty space at the bottom of the RAM stick and the gap between the sockets in the slot to determine which way to place the RAM. Then apply a small amount of force on both sides of the stick to push the stick down into the slot, and the latches on the side should come up automatically.
